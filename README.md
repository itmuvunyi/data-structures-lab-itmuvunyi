## Learning Objectives
- Implement a core data structure from scratch in **Python**
- Analyze and document **time complexity**
- Write unit tests with **pytest**
- Connect implementation to **enterprise web development scenarios**
- Practice **Git workflow** and documentation

---

## Assignment Overview

### Step 1: Choose Your Data Structure
Select **ONE** structure to implement:

- **Stack (LIFO)** – Browser history, undo operations  
- **Queue (FIFO)** – Request handling, messaging systems  
- **Linked List** – Dynamic memory, implementing other structures  

⚠️ Only implement the one you choose. Leave other files as starter templates.

---

### Step 2: Implementation
Complete your chosen data structure in `/src/` using the provided templates and TODO comments.

---

### Step 3: Testing & Documentation
- Run and complete tests with **pytest**  
- Fill out **complexity analysis** in `COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS.md`  
- Update README with chosen structure  

---

### Step 4: Submission
- Commit changes with clear messages  
- Push to repository
